US151 - Add email to profile 
===============================================================


# 1. Requirements

>__"As a family member, I want to delete an email account to my profile."__

## 1.1. Description 
* Any family member has the possibility to add delete email their profile. 

# 2. Analysis
To meet this requirement, a few key pieces of data are need: 
- An ID to identify the user ( in this case will be an Email)
- Another email to be deleted to his profile



##2.1. Domain Model 


```puml
@startuml
skinparam sequenceMessageAlign center
skinparam maxMessageSize 300
skinparam linetype ortho
hide empty members
hide circles
skinparam monochrome true
title Domain Model

package "Person Aggregate"{
  class Person <<Entity>> <<Root>> {}
}


class Email <<Value Object>> <<ID>> {}


Person "1" ---r---> "1" Email : mainEmail
Person "1" ---r---> "0..*" Email : otherEmails

```



## 2.2. Product Owner Requirements
During the Sprint, the product owner (PO) set some specifications that contribute to the design and implementation of 
the US.

> Q: Can a person (or administrator) belong to more than one family?
- No.If a person wants to be a part of another family, they must use another email address.

- Also, a person, i.e. the member of a family, has a name, unique ID (email) and VAT number (...).
Most persons will also have one or more telephone numbers and other email accounts. 

> Q: is it correct to allow Person B to add Person A's uniqueID as a secondary email?
- Don't see a problem.



## 2.3 Decisions
- One of decisions in the beginning of the project, was about the class where the add email operation should be stored, it was decided to implement on the Person because it is an action made by a Person.
- Another decision that was made was to assume that the email to be introduced must be an email that is not assigned already to the user.
- In the event of a case a family member try to add an email list with one email address on invalid format, none of the emails of the present list are added to the email list that the person has.
- Taking into account the possibility that a person may belong to two families, he cannot have the same email to be added to both.
- The ID is unique but the other emails can be repeated.

## 2.4. US Dependencies

* This User Story has other user stories dependencies, like US150(get my profileâ€™s information), US010 (to create a family) and US101 (add family members),
 because that is necessary to have a family in order to add family members and to create a profile information, and then an only then it is possible to add an email account to the actor's profile.
 
## 2.5. System Sequence Diagram

```puml
skinparam monochrome true
autonumber
title SSD
actor "Family Member"

"Family Member" -> "System" : delete an email account from my profile 
activate "Family Member"
activate "System"
|||  
"Family Member" <-- "System" : asks my personID and email to delete

"Family Member" -> "System" : inputs my personID and email

|||
"Family Member" <-- "System" : returns result
deactivate "Family Member"
deactivate "System"

```
 
 
# 3. Design

## 3.1. Functionalities Flow

```puml
@startuml
skinparam monochrome true

autonumber
title Delete an Email Account to Profile

participant ":Icontroller" as controller
participant "PersonService :IPersonService" as PersonService
participant "personId : ID" as personId
participant "otherEmail : Email" as Email
participant ":IPersonRepository" as PersonRepository
participant ":Person" as Person




[o-> controller : POST \nfamilies/{personID}/emails
activate controller
controller -> PersonService : deleteEmailFromProfile(personID,otherEmail)
activate PersonService


PersonService ----> personId ** : create (personIDString)
|||
PersonService --> Email ** : create (emailToInput)
|||
|||


PersonService -> PersonRepository: findById(personID)
activate PersonRepository

|||
PersonRepository --> PersonService: aPerson
deactivate PersonRepository

|||

PersonService --> Person: deleteEmail(otherEmail)
activate Person
opt email exists
Person ---> Person : containsEmail(otherEmail)
else
Person ---> Person : deleteEmail(otherEmail)
deactivate Email
end
    Person --> PersonService : sucess
deactivate Person
|||
PersonService --> PersonRepository: save(aPerson)

|||
activate PersonRepository
deactivate PersonRepository


    PersonService --> controller : sucess 
|||

    deactivate PersonService
  
    

    
    deactivate PersonService
    
    
[<--o  controller : HTTP response  
deactivate controller

```

## 3.2. Class Diagram

## 3.3. Applied Design Patterns

# 4. Implementation

# 5. Integration/Demo


# 6. Observations

Given the possibility of creating a family member without an email, the group defined that the if the email is not valid, it will be replace by an empty list.
This brought the need to validate, in the Person and Person Service classes, the inserted email, preventing the addition of a null email address.
